### Notable Issues

1. no route groups for the entry page (`/`)
2. next.js doc says all the components called inside a client compoennt are also client components, but it does not exactly mean that I don't need to declare those components as client components explicitly, even in the case of common components like buttons or svgs.
3. server preservation in dev mode sucks.
4. `WriteModal` is overlapped by the keyboard on mobile devices(iPad), which needs to be fixed by adjusting the position of the modal.
5. event target and current target do not match if state changes that trigger content of a component to be switched happen by click event.
6. box-sizing is not inherited in production mode.
7. recoil root on template.ts is initialized every time users navigate to another page, which causes the loss of the latest state.
